Low-Level Design Projects
Welcome to my Low-Level Design (LLD) Projects repository! This repository is a collection of practical projects and implementations focused on learning and mastering low-level system design concepts. Through hands-on coding and well-documented designs, I aim to deepen my understanding of design patterns, object-oriented programming (OOP), and system design principles.
üéØ Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to:

Learn low-level system design by implementing real-world design patterns and architectural solutions.
Practice OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, in various programming languages.
Document my journey of understanding system design through clear code, detailed explanations, and design artifacts.
Build a portfolio of well-designed projects to demonstrate my skills in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable software components.

This repository serves as both a personal learning resource and a reference for others interested in low-level design.

üöÄ Projects
This repository includes a variety of low-level design projects, each focusing on a specific design pattern or system design concept. Below are some highlighted projects:
Singleton Pattern (PHP)

Description: An implementation of the Singleton design pattern in PHP, ensuring a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to it. The project includes a robust implementation with lazy initialization, protection against cloning and unserialization, and a practical example using a database connection.
Key Features:
Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
Static getInstance() method for accessing the single instance.
Protection against cloning (__clone) and unserialization (__wakeup).
Example usage with a key-value store and database connection.


Files:
Singleton.php: Core Singleton class implementation.
DatabaseConnection.php: Practical example applying the Singleton pattern.


Learning Outcomes:
Understanding the Singleton pattern and its use cases (e.g., configuration management, logging).
Handling edge cases like cloning and serialization.
Applying OOP principles in PHP.



More projects coming soon, including Factory Pattern, Observer Pattern, and more!
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Languages: PHP (primary), with plans to include Python, Java, and C++ in future projects.
Tools: 
Git for version control.
Composer for PHP dependency management.
Markdown for documentation.


Environment: Any PHP-compatible environment (e.g., XAMPP, Laravel Valet, or Docker).

üìñ How to Use
Prerequisites

PHP 7.4 or higher.
Composer (optional, for managing dependencies).
A code editor like VS Code or PHPStorm.

Setup

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/low-level-design-projects.git
cd low-level-design-projects


Run a Project:
Navigate to a project folder (e.g., singleton-pattern).
Run the PHP script:php Singleton.php




Explore the Code:
Read the inline comments and documentation for detailed explanations.
Modify the code to experiment with different scenarios or extend functionality.



Running Tests

Tests are not yet implemented but planned for future updates.
To manually test, execute the PHP scripts and verify the output matches expected behavior (e.g., confirming only one instance is created in the Singleton pattern).

üåü Why Low-Level Design?
Low-level design focuses on designing the internal structure of software components, such as classes, methods, and data structures. It bridges the gap between high-level system architecture and actual code implementation. By practicing LLD, I aim to:

Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
Master design patterns to solve common software engineering problems.
Build a strong foundation for tackling complex system design challenges.

This repository reflects my commitment to learning through hands-on projects, iterative improvement, and clear documentation.
üìö Learning Resources
To complement the projects in this repository, I recommend the following resources for learning low-level design:

Books:
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma et al.
Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.


Online Courses:
Coursera: Object-Oriented Design by University of Alberta.
Udemy: Design Patterns in PHP or similar courses.


Websites:
Refactoring.Guru (detailed guides on design patterns).
SourceMaking.com (tutorials and examples).
