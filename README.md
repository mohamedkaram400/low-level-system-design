# Low-Level System Design (LLD)

A collection of **low-level system design implementations** written in **PHP**, focusing on **object-oriented design, design patterns, and clean architecture**.

This repository is used to practice designing real-world systems by breaking requirements into well-structured classes and interactions.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Practice **Low-Level Design (LLD)** by:
- Designing systems from requirements
- Applying SOLID principles
- Using appropriate design patterns
- Writing clean, extensible, and testable code

Each folder represents a **separate design problem**.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- PHP
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Design Patterns
- Composer (basic setup)

---

## 🧠 Design Principles Used

- SOLID principles
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed principle
- Dependency Inversion
- Composition over inheritance

---

## 🧩 Design Patterns Applied

- Factory
- Observer
- Strategy
- State
- Singleton (where applicable)

---

## 🛠 How to Use

Each project is self-contained:
1. Open the project folder
2. Review the design and class structure
3. Run the main/demo file (if provided)
4. Inspect how objects interact

This repository is focused on **design clarity**, not UI or frameworks.

---

## 📝 Notes & Assumptions

- This is a learning-focused repository
- No database or frontend integration
- Some implementations are simplified to highlight design concepts
- Emphasis is on **structure and extensibility**, not production deployment
